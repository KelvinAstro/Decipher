{Gregory o my word well not carry coals

No for then we should be colliers

I mean an we be in choler well draw

Ay while you live draw your neck out o the collar

I strike quickly being moved

But thou art not quickly moved to strike

A dog of the house of Montague moves me

To move is to stir and to be valiant is to stand
therefore if thou art moved thou runnst away

A dog of that house shall move me to stand I will
take the wall of any man or maid of Montagues

That shows thee a weak slave for the weakest goes
to the wall

True and therefore women being the weaker vessels
are ever thrust to the wall therefore I will push
Montagues men from the wall and thrust his maids
to the wall}

{The quarrel is between our masters and us their men

Tis all one I will show myself a tyrant when I
have fought with the men I will be cruel with the
maids and cut off their heads

The heads of the maids

They must take it in sense that feel it

{Part fools
Put up your swords you know not what you do





What art thou drawn among these heartless hinds
Turn thee Benvolio look upon thy death

I do but keep the peace put up thy sword
Or manage it to part these men with me

What drawn and talk of peace I hate the word
As I hate hell all Montagues and thee
Have at thee coward





First Citizen Clubs bills and partisans strike beat them down
Down with the Capulets down with the Montagues



What noise is this Give me my long sword ho

A crutch a crutch why call you for a sword

My sword I say Old Montague is come
And flourishes his blade in spite of me



Thou villain CapuletHold me not let me go

Thou shalt not stir a foot to seek a foe



PRINCE Rebellious subjects enemies to peace
Profaners of this neighbourstained steel
Will they not hear What ho you men you beasts
That quench the fire of your pernicious rage
With purple fountains issuing from your veins
On pain of torture from those bloody hands
Throw your mistemperd weapons to the ground
And hear the sentence of your moved prince
Three civil brawls bred of an airy word
By thee old Capulet and Montague
Have thrice disturbd the quiet of our streets
And made Veronas ancient citizens
Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments
To wield old partisans in hands as old
Cankerd with peace to part your cankerd hate
If ever you disturb our streets again
Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace
For this time all the rest depart away
You Capulet shall go along with me
And Montague come you this afternoon
To know our further pleasure in this case
To old Freetown our common judgmentplace
Once more on pain of death all men depart}

{Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach
Speak nephew were you by when it began

Here were the servants of your adversary
And yours close fighting ere I did approach
I drew to part them in the instant came
The fiery Tybalt with his sword prepared
Which as he breathed defiance to my ears
He swung about his head and cut the winds
Who nothing hurt withal hissd him in scorn
While we were interchanging thrusts and blows
Came more and more and fought on part and part
Till the prince came who parted either part

O where is Romeo saw you him today
Right glad I am he was not at this fray

Madam an hour before the worshippd sun
Peerd forth the golden window of the east
A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad
Where underneath the grove of sycamore
That westward rooteth from the citys side
So early walking did I see your son
Towards him I made but he was ware of me
And stole into the covert of the wood
I measuring his affections by my own
That most are busied when theyre most alone
Pursued my humour not pursuing his
And gladly shunnd who gladly fled from me}

{Many a morning hath he there been seen
With tears augmenting the fresh morning dew
Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs
But all so soon as the allcheering sun
Should in the furthest east begin to draw
The shady curtains from Auroras bed
Away from the light steals home my heavy son
And private in his chamber pens himself
Shuts up his windows locks far daylight out
And makes himself an artificial night
Black and portentous must this humour prove
Unless good counsel may the cause remove

My noble uncle do you know the cause

I neither know it nor can learn of him

Have you importuned him by any means

Both by myself and many other friends
But he his own affections counsellor
Is to himselfI will not say how true
But to himself so secret and so close
So far from sounding and discovery
As is the bud bit with an envious worm
Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air
Or dedicate his beauty to the sun
Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow
We would as willingly give cure as know}

But new struck nine

Ay me sad hours seem long
Was that my father that went hence so fast

It was What sadness lengthens Romeos hours

Not having that which having makes them short

In love

Out

Of love

Out of her favour where I am in love

Alas that love so gentle in his view
Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof}

Where shall we dine O me What fray was here
Yet tell me not for I have heard it all
Heres much to do with hate but more with love
Why then O brawling love O loving hate
O any thing of nothing first create
O heavy lightness serious vanity
Misshapen chaos of wellseeming forms
Feather of lead bright smoke cold fire
sick health
Stillwaking sleep that is not what it is
This love feel I that feel no love in this
Dost thou not laugh

No coz I rather weep

Good heart at what

At thy good hearts oppression

Why such is loves transgression
Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast
Which thou wilt propagate to have it prest
With more of thine this love that thou hast shown
Doth add more grief to too much of mine own
Love is a smoke raised with the fume of sighs
Being purged a fire sparkling in lovers eyes
Being vexd a sea nourishd with lovers tears
What is it else a madness most discreet
A choking gall and a preserving sweet
Farewell my coz}

I aimd so near when I supposed you loved

A right good markman And shes fair I love

Well in that hit you miss shell not be hit
With Cupids arrow she hath Dians wit
And in strong proof of chastity well armd
From loves weak childish bow she lives unharmd
She will not stay the siege of loving terms
Nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes
Nor ope her lap to saintseducing gold
O she is rich in beauty only poor
That when she dies with beauty dies her store}

Do I live dead that live to tell it now

Be ruled by me forget to think of her

O teach me how I should forget to think

By giving liberty unto thine eyes
Examine other beauties

Tis the way
To call hers exquisite in question more
These happy masks that kiss fair ladies brows
Being black put us in mind they hide the fair
He that is strucken blind cannot forget
The precious treasure of his eyesight lost
Show me a mistress that is passing fair
What doth her beauty serve but as a note
Where I may read who passd that passing fair
Farewell thou canst not teach me to forget

{But Montague is bound as well as I
In penalty alike and tis not hard I think
For men so old as we to keep the peace

Of honourable reckoning are you both
And pity tis you lived at odds so long
But now my lord what say you to my suit

But saying oer what I have said before
My child is yet a stranger in the world
She hath not seen the change of fourteen years
Let two more summers wither in their pride
Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride

Younger than she are happy mothers made

And too soon marrd are those so early made
The earth hath swallowd all my hopes but she
She is the hopeful lady of my earth
But woo her gentle Paris get her heart
My will to her consent is but a part
An she agree within her scope of choice
Lies my consent and fair according voice
This night I hold an old accustomd feast
Whereto I have invited many a guest
Such as I love and you among the store
One more most welcome makes my number more
At my poor house look to behold this night
Earthtreading stars that make dark heaven light
Such comfort as do lusty young men feel
When wellapparelld April on the heel
Of limping winter treads even such delight
Among fresh female buds shall you this night
Inherit at my house hear all all see
And like her most whose merit most shall be
Which on more view of many mine being one
May stand in number though in reckoning none
Come go with me}

{Go sirrah trudge about
Through fair Verona find those persons out
Whose names are written there and to them say
My house and welcome on their pleasure stay



Find them out whose names are written here It is
written that the shoemaker should meddle with his
yard and the tailor with his last the fisher with
his pencil and the painter with his nets but I am
sent to find those persons whose names are here
writ and can never find what names the writing
person hath here writ I must to the learnedIn good time



Tut man one fire burns out anothers burning
One pain is lessend by anothers anguish
Turn giddy and be holp by backward turning
One desperate grief cures with anothers languish
Take thou some new infection to thy eye
And the rank poison of the old will die}

For what I pray thee

For your broken shin

Why Romeo art thou mad

Not mad but bound more than a madman is
Shut up in prison kept without my food
Whippd and tormented andGodden good fellow

God gi godden I pray sir can you read

Ay mine own fortune in my misery

Perhaps you have learned it without book but I
pray can you read any thing you see

Ay if I know the letters and the language

{Up

Whither

To supper to our house

Whose house

My masters

Indeed I should have askd you that before

Now Ill tell you without asking my master is the
great rich Capulet and if you be not of the house
of Montagues I pray come and crush a cup of wine
Rest you merry



At this same ancient feast of Capulets
Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so lovest
With all the admired beauties of Verona
Go thither and with unattainted eye
Compare her face with some that I shall show
And I will make thee think thy swan a crow

When the devout religion of mine eye
Maintains such falsehood then turn tears to fires
And these who often drownd could never die
Transparent heretics be burnt for liars
One fairer than my love the allseeing sun
Neer saw her match since first the world begun

Tut you saw her fair none else being by
Herself poised with herself in either eye
But in that crystal scales let there be weighd
Your ladys love against some other maid
That I will show you shining at this feast
And she shall scant show well that now shows best

Ill go along no such sight to be shown
But to rejoice in splendor of mine own}

Now by my maidenhead at twelve year old
I bade her come What lamb what ladybird
God forbid Wheres this girl What Juliet



How now who calls

This is the matterNurse give leave awhile
We must talk in secretnurse come back again
I have rememberd me thous hear our counsel
Thou knowst my daughters of a pretty age

Faith I can tell her age unto an hour

Shes not fourteen

Ill lay fourteen of my teeth
And yet to my teeth be it spoken I have but four
She is not fourteen How long is it now
To Lammastide

{Even or odd of all days in the year
Come Lammaseve at night shall she be fourteen
Susan and sheGod rest all Christian souls
Were of an age well Susan is with God
She was too good for me but as I said
On Lammaseve at night shall she be fourteen
That shall she marry I remember it well
Tis since the earthquake now eleven years
And she was weandI never shall forget it
Of all the days of the year upon that day
For I had then laid wormwood to my dug
Sitting in the sun under the dovehouse wall
My lord and you were then at Mantua
Nay I do bear a brainbut as I said
When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple
Of my dug and felt it bitter pretty fool
To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug
Shake quoth the dovehouse twas no need I trow
To bid me trudge
And since that time it is eleven years
For then she could stand alone nay by the rood
She could have run and waddled all about
For even the day before she broke her brow
And then my husbandGod be with his soul
A was a merry mantook up the child
Yea quoth he dost thou fall upon thy face
Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit
Wilt thou not Jule and by my holidame
The pretty wretch left crying and said Ay
To see now how a jest shall come about
I warrant an I should live a thousand years
I never should forget it Wilt thou not Jule quoth he
And pretty fool it stinted and said Ay}

{Enough of this I pray thee hold thy peace

Yes madam yet I cannot choose but laugh
To think it should leave crying and say Ay
And yet I warrant it had upon its brow
A bump as big as a young cockerels stone
A parlous knock and it cried bitterly
Yea quoth my husbandfallst upon thy face
Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age
Wilt thou not Jule it stinted and said Ay

And stint thou too I pray thee nurse say I

Peace I have done God mark thee to his grace
Thou wast the prettiest babe that eer I nursed
An I might live to see thee married once
I have my wish

Marry that marry is the very theme
I came to talk of Tell me daughter Juliet
How stands your disposition to be married

It is an honour that I dream not of

An honour were not I thine only nurse
I would say thou hadst suckd wisdom from thy teat

Well think of marriage now younger than you
Here in Verona ladies of esteem
Are made already mothers by my count
I was your mother much upon these years
That you are now a maid Thus then in brief
The valiant Paris seeks you for his love

A man young lady lady such a man
As all the worldwhy hes a man of wax

Veronas summer hath not such a flower

Nay hes a flower in faith a very flower}

{What say you can you love the gentleman
This night you shall behold him at our feast
Read oer the volume of young Paris face
And find delight writ there with beautys pen
Examine every married lineament
And see how one another lends content
And what obscured in this fair volume lies
Find written in the margent of his eyes
This precious book of love this unbound lover
To beautify him only lacks a cover
The fish lives in the sea and tis much pride
For fair without the fair within to hide
That book in manys eyes doth share the glory
That in gold clasps locks in the golden story
So shall you share all that he doth possess
By having him making yourself no less

No less nay bigger women grow by men

Speak briefly can you like of Paris love

Ill look to like if looking liking move
But no more deep will I endart mine eye
Than your consent gives strength to make it fly



Madam the guests are come supper served up you
called my young lady asked for the nurse cursed in
the pantry and every thing in extremity I must
hence to wait I beseech you follow straight}

Juliet the county stays

Go girl seek happy nights to happy days







What shall this speech be spoke for our excuse
Or shall we on without a apology

The date is out of such prolixity
Well have no Cupid hoodwinkd with a scarf
Bearing a Tartars painted bow of lath
Scaring the ladies like a crowkeeper
Nor no withoutbook prologue faintly spoke
After the prompter for our entrance
But let them measure us by what they will
Well measure them a measure and be gone}

{Give me a torch I am not for this ambling
Being but heavy I will bear the light

Nay gentle Romeo we must have you dance

Not I believe me you have dancing shoes
With nimble soles I have a soul of lead
So stakes me to the ground I cannot move

You are a lover borrow Cupids wings
And soar with them above a common bound

I am too sore enpierced with his shaft
To soar with his light feathers and so bound
I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe
Under loves heavy burden do I sink

And to sink in it should you burden love
Too great oppression for a tender thing

Is love a tender thing it is too rough
Too rude too boisterous and it pricks like thorn

If love be rough with you be rough with love
Prick love for pricking and you beat love down
Give me a case to put my visage in
A visor for a visor what care I
What curious eye doth quote deformities
Here are the beetle brows shall blush for me

Come knock and enter and no sooner in
But every man betake him to his legs

A torch for me let wantons light of heart
Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels
For I am proverbd with a grandsire phrase
Ill be a candleholder and look on
The game was neer so fair and I am done

Tut duns the mouse the constables own word
If thou art dun well draw thee from the mire
Of this sirreverence love wherein thou stickst
Up to the ears Come we burn daylight ho

Nay thats not so

I mean sir in delay
We waste our lights in vain like lamps by day
Take our good meaning for our judgment sits
Five times in that ere once in our five wits

And we mean well in going to this mask
But tis no wit to go}

{O then I see Queen Mab hath been with you
She is the fairies midwife and she comes
In shape no bigger than an agatestone
On the forefinger of an alderman
Drawn with a team of little atomies
Athwart mens noses as they lie asleep
Her wagonspokes made of long spiders legs
The cover of the wings of grasshoppers
The traces of the smallest spiders web
The collars of the moonshines watery beams
Her whip of crickets bone the lash of film
Her wagoner a small greycoated gnat
Not so big as a round little worm
Prickd from the lazy finger of a maid
Her chariot is an empty hazelnut
Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub
Time out o mind the fairies coachmakers
And in this state she gallops night by night
Through lovers brains and then they dream of love
Oer courtiers knees that dream on courtsies straight
Oer lawyers fingers who straight dream on fees
Oer ladies  lips who straight on kisses dream
Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues
Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are
Sometime she gallops oer a courtiers nose
And then dreams he of smelling out a suit
And sometime comes she with a tithepigs tail
Tickling a parsons nose as a lies asleep
Then dreams he of another benefice
Sometime she driveth oer a soldiers neck
And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats
Of breaches ambuscadoes Spanish blades
Of healths fivefathom deep and then anon
Drums in his ear at which he starts and wakes
And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two
And sleeps again This is that very Mab
That plats the manes of horses in the night
And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs
Which once untangled much misfortune bodes
This is the hag when maids lie on their backs
That presses them and learns them first to bear
Making them women of good carriage
This is she}

{Peace peace Mercutio peace
Thou talkst of nothing

True I talk of dreams
Which are the children of an idle brain
Begot of nothing but vain fantasy
Which is as thin of substance as the air
And more inconstant than the wind who wooes
Even now the frozen bosom of the north
And being angerd puffs away from thence
Turning his face to the dewdropping south

This wind you talk of blows us from ourselves
Supper is done and we shall come too late

I fear too early for my mind misgives
Some consequence yet hanging in the stars
Shall bitterly begin his fearful date
With this nights revels and expire the term
Of a despised life closed in my breast
By some vile forfeit of untimely death
But He that hath the steerage of my course
Direct my sail On lusty gentlemen

Strike drum}

Welcome gentlemen ladies that have their toes
Unplagued with corns will have a bout with you
Ah ha my mistresses which of you all
Will now deny to dance she that makes dainty
She Ill swear hath corns am I come near ye now
Welcome gentlemen I have seen the day
That I have worn a visor and could tell
A whispering tale in a fair ladys ear
Such as would please tis gone tis gone tis gone
You are welcome gentlemen come musicians play

And quench the fire the room is grown too hot
Ah sirrah this unlookdfor sport comes well
Nay sit nay sit good cousin Capulet
For you and I are past our dancing days
How long ist now since last yourself and I
Were in a mask

Second Capulet Byr lady thirty years

What man tis not so much tis not so much
Tis since the nuptials of Lucentio
Come pentecost as quickly as it will
Some five and twenty years and then we maskd

Second Capulet Tis more tis more his son is elder sir
His son is thirty

Will you tell me that
His son was but a ward two years ago

What lady is that which doth
enrich the hand
Of yonder knight

{O she doth teach the torches to burn bright
It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night
Like a rich jewel in an Ethiopes ear
Beauty too rich for use for earth too dear
So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows
As yonder lady oer her fellows shows
The measure done Ill watch her place of stand
And touching hers make blessed my rude hand
Did my heart love till now forswear it sight
For I neer saw true beauty till this night

This by his voice should be a Montague
Fetch me my rapier boy What dares the slave
Come hither coverd with an antic face
To fleer and scorn at our solemnity
Now by the stock and honour of my kin
To strike him dead I hold it not a sin

Why how now kinsman wherefore storm you so

Uncle this is a Montague our foe
A villain that is hither come in spite
To scorn at our solemnity this night

Young Romeo is it

Tis he that villain Romeo

Content thee gentle coz let him alone
He bears him like a portly gentleman
And to say truth Verona brags of him
To be a virtuous and wellgovernd youth
I would not for the wealth of all the town
Here in my house do him disparagement
Therefore be patient take no note of him
It is my will the which if thou respect
Show a fair presence and put off these frowns
And illbeseeming semblance for a feast}

{If I profane with my unworthiest hand
This holy shrine the gentle fine is this
My lips two blushing pilgrims ready stand
To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss

Good pilgrim you do wrong your hand too much
Which mannerly devotion shows in this
For saints have hands that pilgrims hands do touch
And palm to palm is holy palmers kiss

Have not saints lips and holy palmers too

Ay pilgrim lips that they must use in prayer

O then dear saint let lips do what hands do
They pray grant thou lest faith turn to despair

Saints do not move though grant for prayers sake

Then move not while my prayers effect I take
Thus from my lips by yours my sin is purged}

Marry that I think be young Petrucio

Whats he that follows there that would not dance

I know not

Go ask his name if he be married
My grave is like to be my wedding bed

His name is Romeo and a Montague
The only son of your great enemy

My only love sprung from my only hate
Too early seen unknown and known too late
Prodigious birth of love it is to me
That I must love a loathed enemy

Whats this whats this

A rhyme I learnd even now
Of one I danced withal

{Chorus Now old desire doth in his deathbed lie
And young affection gapes to be his heir
That fair for which love groand for and would die
With tender Juliet matchd is now not fair
Now Romeo is beloved and loves again
Alike betwitched by the charm of looks
But to his foe supposed he must complain
And she steal loves sweet bait from fearful hooks
Being held a foe he may not have access
To breathe such vows as lovers use to swear
And she as much in love her means much less
To meet her newbeloved any where
But passion lends them power time means to meet
Tempering extremities with extreme sweet}

He is wise
And on my lie hath stoln him home to bed

He ran this way and leapd this orchard wall
Call good Mercutio

Nay Ill conjure too
Romeo humours madman passion lover
Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh
Speak but one rhyme and I am satisfied
Cry but Ay me pronounce but love and dove
Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word
One nickname for her purblind son and heir
Young Adam Cupid he that shot so trim
When King Cophetua loved the beggarmaid
He heareth not he stirreth not he moveth not
The ape is dead and I must conjure him
I conjure thee by Rosalines bright eyes
By her high forehead and her scarlet lip
By her fine foot straight leg and quivering thigh
And the demesnes that there adjacent lie
That in thy likeness thou appear to us

And if he hear thee thou wilt anger him

This cannot anger him twould anger him
To raise a spirit in his mistress circle
Of some strange nature letting it there stand
Till she had laid it and conjured it down
That were some spite my invocation
Is fair and honest and in his mistress name
I conjure only but to raise up him}

{He jests at scars that never felt a wound



But soft what light through yonder window breaks
It is the east and Juliet is the sun
Arise fair sun and kill the envious moon
Who is already sick and pale with grief
That thou her maid art far more fair than she
Be not her maid since she is envious
Her vestal livery is but sick and green
And none but fools do wear it cast it off
It is my lady O it is my love
O that she knew she were
She speaks yet she says nothing what of that
Her eye discourses I will answer it
I am too bold tis not to me she speaks
Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven
Having some business do entreat her eyes
To twinkle in their spheres till they return
What if her eyes were there they in her head
The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars
As daylight doth a lamp her eyes in heaven
Would through the airy region stream so bright
That birds would sing and think it were not night
See how she leans her cheek upon her hand
O that I were a glove upon that hand
That I might touch that cheek}

{Ay me

She speaks
O speak again bright angel for thou art
As glorious to this night being oer my head
As is a winged messenger of heaven
Unto the whiteupturned wondering eyes
Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him
When he bestrides the lazypacing clouds
And sails upon the bosom of the air

O Romeo Romeo wherefore art thou Romeo
Deny thy father and refuse thy name
Or if thou wilt not be but sworn my love
And Ill no longer be a Capulet

Shall I hear more or shall I speak at this

Tis but thy name that is my enemy
Thou art thyself though not a Montague
Whats Montague it is nor hand nor foot
Nor arm nor face nor any other part
Belonging to a man O be some other name
Whats in a name that which we call a rose
By any other name would smell as sweet
So Romeo would were he not Romeo calld
Retain that dear perfection which he owes
Without that title Romeo doff thy name
And for that name which is no part of thee
Take all myself}

{I take thee at thy word
Call me but love and Ill be new baptized
Henceforth I never will be Romeo

What man art thou that thus bescreend in night
So stumblest on my counsel

By a name
I know not how to tell thee who I am
My name dear saint is hateful to myself
Because it is an enemy to thee
Had I it written I would tear the word

My ears have not yet drunk a hundred words
Of that tongues utterance yet I know the sound
Art thou not Romeo and a Montague

Neither fair saint if either thee dislike

How camest thou hither tell me and wherefore
The orchard walls are high and hard to climb
And the place death considering who thou art
If any of my kinsmen find thee here

With loves light wings did I oerperch these walls
For stony limits cannot hold love out
And what love can do that dares love attempt
Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me

If they do see thee they will murder thee

Alack there lies more peril in thine eye
Than twenty of their swords look thou but sweet
And I am proof against their enmity

I would not for the world they saw thee here

I have nights cloak to hide me from their sight
And but thou love me let them find me here
My life were better ended by their hate
Than death prorogued wanting of thy love

By whose direction foundst thou out this place

By love who first did prompt me to inquire
He lent me counsel and I lent him eyes
I am no pilot yet wert thou as far
As that vast shore washd with the farthest sea
I would adventure for such merchandise

Thou knowst the mask of night is on my face
Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
For that which thou hast heard me speak tonight
Fain would I dwell on form fain fain deny
What I have spoke but farewell compliment
Dost thou love me I know thou wilt say Ay
And I will take thy word yet if thou swearst
Thou mayst prove false at lovers perjuries
Then say Jove laughs O gentle Romeo
If thou dost love pronounce it faithfully
Or if thou thinkst I am too quickly won
Ill frown and be perverse an say thee nay
So thou wilt woo but else not for the world
In truth fair Montague I am too fond
And therefore thou mayst think my havior light
But trust me gentleman Ill prove more true
Than those that have more cunning to be strange
I should have been more strange I must confess
But that thou overheardst ere I was ware
My true loves passion therefore pardon me
And not impute this yielding to light love
Which the dark night hath so discovered

Lady by yonder blessed moon I swear
That tips with silver all these fruittree tops

O swear not by the moon the inconstant moon
That monthly changes in her circled orb
Lest that thy love prove likewise variable

What shall I swear by

Do not swear at all
Or if thou wilt swear by thy gracious self
Which is the god of my idolatry
And Ill believe thee

If my hearts dear love

Well do not swear although I joy in thee
I have no joy of this contract tonight
It is too rash too unadvised too sudden
Too like the lightning which doth cease to be
Ere one can say It lightens Sweet good night
This bud of love by summers ripening breath
May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet
Good night good night as sweet repose and rest
Come to thy heart as that within my breast}

{O wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied

What satisfaction canst thou have tonight

The exchange of thy loves faithful vow for mine

I gave thee mine before thou didst request it
And yet I would it were to give again

Wouldst thou withdraw it for what purpose love

But to be frank and give it thee again
And yet I wish but for the thing I have
My bounty is as boundless as the sea
My love as deep the more I give to thee
The more I have for both are infinite



I hear some noise within dear love adieu
Anon good nurse Sweet Montague be true
Stay but a little I will come again



O blessed blessed night I am afeard
Being in night all this is but a dream
Too flatteringsweet to be substantial



Three words dear Romeo and good night indeed
If that thy bent of love be honourable
Thy purpose marriage send me word tomorrow
By one that Ill procure to come to thee
Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite
And all my fortunes at thy foot Ill lay
And follow thee my lord throughout the world}

I come anonBut if thou meanst not well
I do beseech thee

Madam

By and by I come
To cease thy suit and leave me to my grief
Tomorrow will I send

So thrive my soul

A thousand times good night



A thousand times the worse to want thy light
Love goes toward love as schoolboys from
their books
But love from love toward school with heavy looks


Hist Romeo hist O for a falconers voice
To lure this tasselgentle back again
Bondage is hoarse and may not speak aloud
Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies
And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine
With repetition of my Romeos name

It is my soul that calls upon my name
How silversweet sound lovers tongues by night
Like softest music to attending ears

Romeo

My dear

At what oclock tomorrow
Shall I send to thee}

I will not fail tis twenty years till then
I have forgot why I did call thee back

Let me stand here till thou remember it

I shall forget to have thee still stand there
Remembering how I love thy company

And Ill still stay to have thee still forget
Forgetting any other home but this

Tis almost morning I would have thee gone
And yet no further than a wantons bird
Who lets it hop a little from her hand
Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves
And with a silk thread plucks it back again
So lovingjealous of his liberty}

{FRIAR LAURENCE The greyeyed morn smiles on the frowning night
Chequering the eastern clouds with streaks of light
And flecked darkness like a drunkard reels
From forth days path and Titans fiery wheels
Now ere the sun advance his burning eye
The day to cheer and nights dank dew to dry
I must upfill this osier cage of ours
With baleful weeds and preciousjuiced flowers
The earth thats natures mother is her tomb
What is her burying grave that is her womb
And from her womb children of divers kind
We sucking on her natural bosom find
Many for many virtues excellent
None but for some and yet all different
O mickle is the powerful grace that lies
In herbs plants stones and their true qualities
For nought so vile that on the earth doth live
But to the earth some special good doth give
Nor aught so good but straind from that fair use
Revolts from true birth stumbling on abuse
Virtue itself turns vice being misapplied
And vice sometimes by action dignified
Within the infant rind of this small flower
Poison hath residence and medicine power
For this being smelt with that part cheers each part
Being tasted slays all senses with the heart
Two such opposed kings encamp them still
In man as well as herbs grace and rude will
And where the worser is predominant
Full soon the canker death eats up that plant}

{Good morrow father

FRIAR LAURENCE Benedicite
What early tongue so sweet saluteth me
Young son it argues a distemperd head
So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed
Care keeps his watch in every old mans eye
And where care lodges sleep will never lie
But where unbruised youth with unstuffd brain
Doth couch his limbs there golden sleep doth reign
Therefore thy earliness doth me assure
Thou art uproused by some distemperature
Or if not so then here I hit it right
Our Romeo hath not been in bed tonight

That last is true the sweeter rest was mine

FRIAR LAURENCE God pardon sin wast thou with Rosaline

With Rosaline my ghostly father no
I have forgot that name and that names woe

FRIAR LAURENCE Thats my good son but where hast thou been then

Ill tell thee ere thou ask it me again
I have been feasting with mine enemy
Where on a sudden one hath wounded me
Thats by me wounded both our remedies
Within thy help and holy physic lies
I bear no hatred blessed man for lo
My intercession likewise steads my foe

FRIAR LAURENCE Be plain good son and homely in thy drift
Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift

Then plainly know my hearts dear love is set
On the fair daughter of rich Capulet
As mine on hers so hers is set on mine
And all combined save what thou must combine
By holy marriage when and where and how
We met we wood and made exchange of vow
Ill tell thee as we pass but this I pray
That thou consent to marry us today

FRIAR LAURENCE Holy Saint Francis what a change is here
Is Rosaline whom thou didst love so dear
So soon forsaken young mens love then lies
Not truly in their hearts but in their eyes
Jesu Maria what a deal of brine
Hath washd thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline
How much salt water thrown away in waste
To season love that of it doth not taste
The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears
Thy old groans ring yet in my ancient ears
Lo here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit
Of an old tear that is not washd off yet
If eer thou wast thyself and these woes thine
Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline
And art thou changed pronounce this sentence then
Women may fall when theres no strength in men}

{Thou chidst me oft for loving Rosaline

FRIAR LAURENCE For doting not for loving pupil mine

And badst me bury love

FRIAR LAURENCE Not in a grave
To lay one in another out to have

I pray thee chide not she whom I love now
Doth grace for grace and love for love allow
The other did not so

FRIAR LAURENCE O she knew well
Thy love did read by rote and could not spell
But come young waverer come go with me
In one respect Ill thy assistant be
For this alliance may so happy prove
To turn your households rancour to pure love

O let us hence I stand on sudden haste

FRIAR LAURENCE Wisely and slow they stumble that run fast







Where the devil should this Romeo be
Came he not home tonight

Not to his fathers I spoke with his man

Ah that same pale hardhearted wench that Rosaline
Torments him so that he will sure run mad

Tybalt the kinsman of old Capulet
Hath sent a letter to his fathers house

A challenge on my life

Romeo will answer it

Any man that can write may answer a letter

Nay he will answer the letters master how he
dares being dared

Alas poor Romeo he is already dead stabbed with a
white wenchs black eye shot through the ear with a
lovesong the very pin of his heart cleft with the
blind bowboys buttshaft and is he a man to
encounter Tybalt}

The pox of such antic lisping affecting
fantasticoes these new tuners of accents By Jesu
a very good blade a very tall man a very good

grandsire that we should be thus afflicted with
these strange flies these fashionmongers these
perdonamis who stand so much on the new form
that they cannot at ease on the old bench O their

{Here comes Romeo here comes Romeo

Without his roe like a dried herring flesh flesh
how art thou fishified Now is he for the numbers
that Petrarch flowed in Laura to his lady was but a
kitchenwench marry she had a better love to
berhyme her Dido a dowdy Cleopatra a gipsy
Helen and Hero hildings and harlots Thisbe a grey
eye or so but not to the purpose Signior
Romeo bon jour theres a French salutation
to your French slop You gave us the counterfeit
fairly last night

Good morrow to you both What counterfeit did I give you

The ship sir the slip can you not conceive

Pardon good Mercutio my business was great and in
such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy

Thats as much as to say such a case as yours
constrains a man to bow in the hams

Meaning to courtsy

Thou hast most kindly hit it

A most courteous exposition

Nay I am the very pink of courtesy

Pink for flower

Right

Why then is my pump well flowered

Well said follow me this jest now till thou hast
worn out thy pump that when the single sole of it
is worn the jest may remain after the wearing sole singular

O singlesoled jest solely singular for the
singleness

Come between us good Benvolio my wits faint

Switch and spurs switch and spurs or Ill cry a match

Nay if thy wits run the wildgoose chase I have
done for thou hast more of the wildgoose in one of
thy wits than I am sure I have in my whole five
was I with you there for the goose

Thou wast never with me for any thing when thou wast
not there for the goose

I will bite thee by the ear for that jest

Nay good goose bite not

Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting it is a most
sharp sauce

And is it not well served in to a sweet goose

O heres a wit of cheveril that stretches from an
inch narrow to an ell broad

I stretch it out for that word broad which added
to the goose proves thee far and wide a broad goose

Why is not this better now than groaning for love
now art thou sociable now art thou Romeo now art
thou what thou art by art as well as by nature
for this drivelling love is like a great natural
that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in a hole

Stop there stop there

Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair

Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large

O thou art deceived I would have made it short
for I was come to the whole depth of my tale and
meant indeed to occupy the argument no longer}

In half an hour she promised to return
Perchance she cannot meet him thats not so
O she is lame loves heralds should be thoughts
Which ten times faster glide than the suns beams
Driving back shadows over louring hills
Therefore do nimblepiniond doves draw love
And therefore hath the windswift Cupid wings
Now is the sun upon the highmost hill
Of this days journey and from nine till twelve
Is three long hours yet she is not come
Had she affections and warm youthful blood
She would be as swift in motion as a ball
My words would bandy her to my sweet love
And his to me
But old folks many feign as they were dead
Unwieldy slow heavy and pale as lead
O God she comes}

My back o t other sideO my back my back
Beshrew your heart for sending me about

Your love says like an honest gentleman and a
courteous and a kind and a handsome and I

Where is my mother why she is within
Where should she be How oddly thou repliest
Your love says like an honest gentleman

That one short minute gives me in her sight
Do thou but close our hands with holy words
Then lovedevouring death do what he dare
It is enough I may but call her mine

FRIAR LAURENCE These violent delights have violent ends
And in their triumph die like fire and powder
Which as they kiss consume the sweetest honey
Is loathsome in his own deliciousness
And in the taste confounds the appetite
Therefore love moderately long love doth so
Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow



Here comes the lady O so light a foot
Will neer wear out the everlasting flint
A lover may bestride the gossamer
That idles in the wanton summer air
And yet not fall so light is vanity

Good even to my ghostly confessor

FRIAR LAURENCE Romeo shall thank thee daughter for us both

As much to him else is his thanks too much

Ah Juliet if the measure of thy joy
Be heapd like mine and that thy skill be more
To blazon it then sweeten with thy breath
This neighbour air and let rich musics tongue
Unfold the imagined happiness that both
Receive in either by this dear encounter

Conceit more rich in matter than in words
Brags of his substance not of ornament
They are but beggars that can count their worth
But my true love is grown to such excess
I cannot sum up sum of half my wealth

FRIAR LAURENCE Come come with me and we will make short work
For by your leaves you shall not stay alone
Till holy church incorporate two in one}

{I pray thee good Mercutio lets retire
The day is hot the Capulets abroad
And if we meet we shall not scape a brawl
For now these hot days is the mad blood stirring

Thou art like one of those fellows that when he
enters the confines of a tavern claps me his sword
upon the table and says God send me no need of
thee and by the operation of the second cup draws
it on the drawer when indeed there is no need

Am I like such a fellow

Come come thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as
any in Italy and as soon moved to be moody and as
soon moody to be moved

And what to

Nay an there were two such we should have none
shortly for one would kill the other Thou why
thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a hair more
or a hair less in his beard than thou hast thou
wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts having no
other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes what
eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel
Thy head is as fun of quarrels as an egg is full of
meat and yet thy head hath been beaten as addle as
an egg for quarrelling thou hast quarrelled with a
man for coughing in the street because he hath
wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun
didst thou not fall out with a tailor for wearing
his new doublet before Easter with another for
tying his new shoes with old riband and yet thou
wilt tutor me from quarrelling}

{PRINCE Benvolio who began this bloody fray

Tybalt here slain whom Romeos hand did slay
Romeo that spoke him fair bade him bethink
How nice the quarrel was and urged withal
Your high displeasure all this uttered
With gentle breath calm look knees humbly bowd
Could not take truce with the unruly spleen
Of Tybalt deaf to peace but that he tilts
With piercing steel at bold Mercutios breast
Who all as hot turns deadly point to point
And with a martial scorn with one hand beats
Cold death aside and with the other sends
It back to Tybalt whose dexterity
Retorts it Romeo he cries aloud
Hold friends friends part and swifter than
his tongue
His agile arm beats down their fatal points
And twixt them rushes underneath whose arm
An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life
Of stout Mercutio and then Tybalt fled
But by and by comes back to Romeo
Who had but newly entertaind revenge
And to t they go like lightning for ere I
Could draw to part them was stout Tybalt slain
And as he fell did Romeo turn and fly
This is the truth or let Benvolio die

He is a kinsman to the Montague
Affection makes him false he speaks not true
Some twenty of them fought in this black strife
And all those twenty could but kill one life
I beg for justice which thou prince must give
Romeo slew Tybalt Romeo must not live

PRINCE Romeo slew him he slew Mercutio
Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe

Not Romeo prince he was Mercutios friend
His fault concludes but what the law should end
The life of Tybalt

PRINCE And for that offence
Immediately we do exile him hence
I have an interest in your hates proceeding
My blood for your rude brawls doth lie ableeding
But Ill amerce you with so strong a fine
That you shall all repent the loss of mine
I will be deaf to pleading and excuses
Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses
Therefore use none let Romeo hence in haste
Else when hes found that hour is his last
Bear hence this body and attend our will
Mercy but murders pardoning those that kill}

{Gallop apace you fieryfooted steeds
Towards Phoebus lodging such a wagoner
As Phaethon would whip you to the west
And bring in cloudy night immediately
Spread thy close curtain loveperforming night
That runaways eyes may wink and Romeo
Leap to these arms untalkd of and unseen
Lovers can see to do their amorous rites
By their own beauties or if love be blind
It best agrees with night Come civil night
Thou sobersuited matron all in black
And learn me how to lose a winning match
Playd for a pair of stainless maidenhoods
Hood my unmannd blood bating in my cheeks
With thy black mantle till strange love grown bold
Think true love acted simple modesty
Come night come Romeo come thou day in night
For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night
Whiter than new snow on a ravens back
Come gentle night come loving blackbrowd night
Give me my Romeo and when he shall die
Take him and cut him out in little stars
And he will make the face of heaven so fine
That all the world will be in love with night
And pay no worship to the garish sun
O I have bought the mansion of a love
But not possessd it and though I am sold
Not yet enjoyd so tedious is this day
As is the night before some festival
To an impatient child that hath new robes
And may not wear them O here comes my nurse
And she brings news and every tongue that speaks
But Romeos name speaks heavenly eloquence}

{Now nurse what news What hast thou there the cords
That Romeo bid thee fetch

Ay ay the cords



Ay me what news why dost thou wring thy hands

Ah welladay hes dead hes dead hes dead
We are undone lady we are undone
Alack the day hes gone hes killd hes dead

Can heaven be so envious

Romeo can
Though heaven cannot O Romeo Romeo
Who ever would have thought it Romeo

What devil art thou that dost torment me thus
This torture should be roard in dismal hell
Hath Romeo slain himself say thou but I
And that bare vowel I shall poison more
Than the deathdarting eye of cockatrice
I am not I if there be such an I
Or those eyes shut that make thee answer I
If he be slain say I or if not no
Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe}

God save the markhere on his manly breast
A piteous corse a bloody piteous corse
Pale pale as ashes all bedaubd in blood
All in goreblood I swounded at the sight

O break my heart poor bankrupt break at once
To prison eyes neer look on liberty
Vile earth to earth resign end motion here
And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier

O Tybalt Tybalt the best friend I had
O courteous Tybalt honest gentleman
That ever I should live to see thee dead

What storm is this that blows so contrary
Is Romeo slaughterd and is Tybalt dead
My dearloved cousin and my dearer lord
Then dreadful trumpet sound the general doom
For who is living if those two are gone

Tybalt is gone and Romeo banished
Romeo that killd him he is banished}

These griefs these woes these sorrows make me old

Blisterd be thy tongue
For such a wish he was not born to shame
Upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit
For tis a throne where honour may be crownd
Sole monarch of the universal earth
O what a beast was I to chide at him

Will you speak well of him that killd your cousin}

But wherefore villain didst thou kill my cousin
That villain cousin would have killd my husband
Back foolish tears back to your native spring
Your tributary drops belong to woe
Which you mistaking offer up to joy
My husband lives that Tybalt would have slain
And Tybalts dead that would have slain my husband
All this is comfort wherefore weep I then
Some word there was worser than Tybalts death
That murderd me I would forget it fain
But O it presses to my memory
Like damned guilty deeds to sinners minds
Tybalt is dead and Romeobanished
That banished that one word banished
Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts Tybalts death
Was woe enough if it had ended there
Or if sour woe delights in fellowship
And needly will be rankd with other griefs
Why followd not when she said Tybalts dead
Thy father or thy mother nay or both
Which modern lamentations might have moved
But with a rearward following Tybalts death
Romeo is banished to speak that word
Is father mother Tybalt Romeo Juliet
All slain all dead Romeo is banished
There is no end no limit measure bound
In that words death no words can that woe sound
Where is my father and my mother nurse}

When theirs are dry for Romeos banishment
Take up those cords poor ropes you are beguiled

He made you for a highway to my bed
But I a maid die maidenwidowed
Come cords come nurse Ill to my weddingbed
And death not Romeo take my maidenhead

Hie to your chamber Ill find Romeo
To comfort you I wot well where he is
Hark ye your Romeo will be here at night
Ill to him he is hid at Laurence cell

O find him give this ring to my true knight
And bid him come to take his last farewell}

What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand

Is my dear son with such sour company
I bring thee tidings of the princes doom

What less than doomsday is the princes doom

FRIAR LAURENCE A gentler judgment vanishd from his lips
Not bodys death but bodys banishment

Ha banishment be merciful say death
For exile hath more terror in his look
Much more than death do not say banishment

FRIAR LAURENCE Hence from Verona art thou banished
Be patient for the world is broad and wide}

Still blush as thinking their own kisses sin

Flies may do this but I from this must fly
They are free men but I am banished

Hadst thou no poison mixd no sharpground knife
No sudden mean of death though neer so mean
But banished to kill mebanished

Howlings attend it how hast thou the heart
Being a divine a ghostly confessor
A sinabsolver and my friend professd
To mangle me with that word banished}

An hour but married Tybalt murdered
Doting like me and like me banished
Then mightst thou speak then mightst thou tear thy hair
And fall upon the ground as I do now
Taking the measure of an unmade grave}

And Tybalt calls and then on Romeo cries
And then down falls again}

{FRIAR LAURENCE Hold thy desperate hand
Art thou a man thy form cries out thou art
Thy tears are womanish thy wild acts denote
The unreasonable fury of a beast
Unseemly woman in a seeming man
Or illbeseeming beast in seeming both
Thou hast amazed me by my holy order
I thought thy disposition better temperd
Hast thou slain Tybalt wilt thou slay thyself
And stay thy lady too that lives in thee
By doing damned hate upon thyself
Why railst thou on thy birth the heaven and earth
Since birth and heaven and earth all three do meet
In thee at once which thou at once wouldst lose
Fie fie thou shamest thy shape thy love thy wit
Which like a usurer aboundst in all
And usest none in that true use indeed
Which should bedeck thy shape thy love thy wit
Thy noble shape is but a form of wax
Digressing from the valour of a man
Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury
Killing that love which thou hast vowd to cherish
Thy wit that ornament to shape and love
Misshapen in the conduct of them both
Like powder in a skitless soldiers flask
Is set afire by thine own ignorance
And thou dismemberd with thine own defence
What rouse thee man thy Juliet is alive
For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead
There art thou happy Tybalt would kill thee
But thou slewst Tybalt there are thou happy too
The law that threatend death becomes thy friend
And turns it to exile there art thou happy
A pack of blessings lights up upon thy back
Happiness courts thee in her best array
But like a misbehaved and sullen wench
Thou poutst upon thy fortune and thy love
Take heed take heed for such die miserable
Go get thee to thy love as was decreed
Ascend her chamber hence and comfort her
But look thou stay not till the watch be set
For then thou canst not pass to Mantua
Where thou shalt live till we can find a time
To blaze your marriage reconcile your friends
Beg pardon of the prince and call thee back
With twenty hundred thousand times more joy
Than thou wentst forth in lamentation
Go before nurse commend me to thy lady
And bid her hasten all the house to bed
Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto
Romeo is coming}

{O Lord I could have stayd here all the night
To hear good counsel O what learning is
My lord Ill tell my lady you will come

Do so and bid my sweet prepare to chide

Here sir a ring she bid me give you sir
Hie you make haste for it grows very late


How well my comfort is revived by this

FRIAR LAURENCE Go hence good night and here stands all your state
Either be gone before the watch be set
Or by the break of day disguised from hence
Sojourn in Mantua Ill find out your man
And he shall signify from time to time
Every good hap to you that chances here
Give me thy hand tis late farewell good night

But that a joy past joy calls out on me
It were a grief so brief to part with thee Farewell}

{Things have falln out sir so unluckily
That we have had no time to move our daughter
Look you she loved her kinsman Tybalt dearly
And so did IWell we were born to die
Tis very late shell not come down tonight
I promise you but for your company
I would have been abed an hour ago

These times of woe afford no time to woo
Madam good night commend me to your daughter

I will and know her mind early tomorrow
Tonight she is mewd up to her heaviness

Sir Paris I will make a desperate tender
Of my childs love I think she will be ruled
In all respects by me nay more I doubt it not
Wife go you to her ere you go to bed
Acquaint her here of my son Paris love
And bid her mark you me on Wednesday next
But soft what day is this

Monday my lord}

Being our kinsman if we revel much
Therefore well have some half a dozen friends

Well get you gone o Thursday be it then

{Wilt thou be gone it is not yet near day
It was the nightingale and not the lark
That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear
Nightly she sings on yon pomegranatetree
Believe me love it was the nightingale

It was the lark the herald of the morn
No nightingale look love what envious streaks
Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east
Nights candles are burnt out and jocund day
Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops
I must be gone and live or stay and die

Yon light is not daylight I know it I
It is some meteor that the sun exhales
To be to thee this night a torchbearer
And light thee on thy way to Mantua
Therefore stay yet thou needst not to be gone

Let me be taen let me be put to death
I am content so thou wilt have it so
Ill say yon grey is not the mornings eye
Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthias brow
Nor that is not the lark whose notes do beat
The vaulty heaven so high above our heads
I have more care to stay than will to go
Come death and welcome Juliet wills it so
How ist my soul lets talk it is not day}

It is the lark that sings so out of tune
Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps
Some say the lark makes sweet division
This doth not so for she divideth us
Some say the lark and loathed toad change eyes
O now I would they had changed voices too
Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray
Hunting thee hence with huntsup to the day
O now be gone more light and light it grows

More light and light more dark and dark our woes}

But send him back

Is she not down so late or up so early
What unaccustomd cause procures her hither



Why how now Juliet

Madam I am not well

Evermore weeping for your cousins death
What wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears
An if thou couldst thou couldst not make him live
Therefore have done some grief shows much of love
But much of grief shows still some want of wit

Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss

So shall you feel the loss but not the friend
Which you weep for

Feeling so the loss
Cannot choose but ever weep the friend

Well girl thou weepst not so much for his death
As that the villain lives which slaughterd him}

That same villain Romeo

Villain and he be many miles asunder
God Pardon him I do with all my heart
And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart

That is because the traitor murderer lives

Ay madam from the reach of these my hands
Would none but I might venge my cousins death

We will have vengeance for it fear thou not
Then weep no more Ill send to one in Mantua
Where that same banishd runagate doth live
Shall give him such an unaccustomd dram
That he shall soon keep Tybalt company
And then I hope thou wilt be satisfied

Indeed I never shall be satisfied
With Romeo till I behold himdead
Is my poor heart for a kinsman vexd
Madam if you could find out but a man
To bear a poison I would temper it
That Romeo should upon receipt thereof
Soon sleep in quiet O how my heart abhors
To hear him named and cannot come to him
To wreak the love I bore my cousin
Upon his body that slaughterd him

Find thou the means and Ill find such a man
But now Ill tell thee joyful tidings girl

And joy comes well in such a needy time
What are they I beseech your ladyship

Well well thou hast a careful father child
One who to put thee from thy heaviness
Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy
That thou expectst not nor I lookd not for}

{Madam in happy time what day is that

Marry my child early next Thursday morn
The gallant young and noble gentleman
The County Paris at Saint Peters Church
Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride

Now by Saint Peters Church and Peter too
He shall not make me there a joyful bride
I wonder at this haste that I must wed
Ere he that should be husband comes to woo
I pray you tell my lord and father madam
I will not marry yet and when I do I swear
It shall be Romeo whom you know I hate
Rather than Paris These are news indeed

Here comes your father tell him so yourself
And see how he will take it at your hands



When the sun sets the air doth drizzle dew
But for the sunset of my brothers son
It rains downright
How now a conduit girl what still in tears
Evermore showering In one little body
Thou counterfeitst a bark a sea a wind
For still thy eyes which I may call the sea
Do ebb and flow with tears the bark thy body is
Sailing in this salt flood the winds thy sighs
Who raging with thy tears and they with them
Without a sudden calm will overset
Thy tempesttossed body How now wife
Have you deliverd to her our decree}

{Gods bread it makes me mad
Day night hour tide time work play
Alone in company still my care hath been
To have her matchd and having now provided
A gentleman of noble parentage
Of fair demesnes youthful and nobly traind
Stuffd as they say with honourable parts
Proportiond as ones thought would wish a man
And then to have a wretched puling fool
A whining mammet in her fortunes tender
To answer Ill not wed I cannot love
I am too young I pray you pardon me
But as you will not wed Ill pardon you
Graze where you will you shall not house with me
Look tot think ont I do not use to jest
Thursday is near lay hand on heart advise
An you be mine Ill give you to my friend
And you be not hang beg starve die in
the streets
For by my soul Ill neer acknowledge thee
Nor what is mine shall never do thee good
Trust tot bethink you Ill not be forsworn



Is there no pity sitting in the clouds
That sees into the bottom of my grief
O sweet my mother cast me not away
Delay this marriage for a month a week
Or if you do not make the bridal bed
In that dim monument where Tybalt lies

Talk not to me for Ill not speak a word
Do as thou wilt for I have done with thee



O GodO nurse how shall this be prevented
My husband is on earth my faith in heaven
How shall that faith return again to earth
Unless that husband send it me from heaven
By leaving earth comfort me counsel me
Alack alack that heaven should practise stratagems
Upon so soft a subject as myself
What sayst thou hast thou not a word of joy
Some comfort nurse

Faith here it is
Romeo is banishd and all the world to nothing
That he dares neer come back to challenge you
Or if he do it needs must be by stealth
Then since the case so stands as now it doth
I think it best you married with the county
O hes a lovely gentleman
Romeos a dishclout to him an eagle madam
Hath not so green so quick so fair an eye
As Paris hath Beshrew my very heart
I think you are happy in this second match
For it excels your first or if it did not
Your first is dead or twere as good he were
As living here and you no use of him}

{Speakest thou from thy heart

And from my soul too
Or else beshrew them both

Amen

What

Well thou hast comforted me marvellous much
Go in and tell my lady I am gone
Having displeased my father to Laurence cell
To make confession and to be absolved

Marry I will and this is wisely done



Ancient damnation O most wicked fiend
Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn
Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue
Which she hath praised him with above compare
So many thousand times Go counsellor
Thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain
Ill to the friar to know his remedy
If all else fail myself have power to die}

{FRIAR LAURENCE On Thursday sir the time is very short

My father Capulet will have it so
And I am nothing slow to slack his haste

FRIAR LAURENCE You say you do not know the ladys mind
Uneven is the course I like it not

Immoderately she weeps for Tybalts death
And therefore have I little talkd of love
For Venus smiles not in a house of tears
Now sir her father counts it dangerous
That she doth give her sorrow so much sway
And in his wisdom hastes our marriage
To stop the inundation of her tears
Which too much minded by herself alone
May be put from her by society
Now do you know the reason of this haste

FRIAR LAURENCE I would I knew not why it should be slowd
Look sir here comes the lady towards my cell



Happily met my lady and my wife

That may be sir when I may be a wife

That may be must be love on Thursday next

What must be shall be

FRIAR LAURENCE Thats a certain text

Come you to make confession to this father

To answer that I should confess to you

Do not deny to him that you love me

I will confess to you that I love him

So will ye I am sure that you love me

If I do so it will be of more price
Being spoke behind your back than to your face

Poor soul thy face is much abused with tears

The tears have got small victory by that
For it was bad enough before their spite

Thou wrongst it more than tears with that report

That is no slander sir which is a truth
And what I spake I spake it to my face

Thy face is mine and thou hast slanderd it

It may be so for it is not mine own
Are you at leisure holy father now
Or shall I come to you at evening mass

FRIAR LAURENCE My leisure serves me pensive daughter now
My lord we must entreat the time alone

God shield I should disturb devotion
Juliet on Thursday early will I rouse ye
Till then adieu and keep this holy kiss}

{O shut the door and when thou hast done so
Come weep with me past hope past cure past help

FRIAR LAURENCE Ah Juliet I already know thy grief
It strains me past the compass of my wits
I hear thou must and nothing may prorogue it
On Thursday next be married to this county

Tell me not friar that thou hearst of this
Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it
If in thy wisdom thou canst give no help
Do thou but call my resolution wise
And with this knife Ill help it presently
God joind my heart and Romeos thou our hands
And ere this hand by thee to Romeo seald
Shall be the label to another deed
Or my true heart with treacherous revolt
Turn to another this shall slay them both
Therefore out of thy longexperienced time
Give me some present counsel or behold
Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife
Shall play the umpire arbitrating that
Which the commission of thy years and art
Could to no issue of true honour bring
Be not so long to speak I long to die
If what thou speakst speak not of remedy}

{FRIAR LAURENCE Hold daughter I do spy a kind of hope
Which craves as desperate an execution
As that is desperate which we would prevent
If rather than to marry County Paris
Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself
Then is it likely thou wilt undertake
A thing like death to chide away this shame
That copest with death himself to scape from it
And if thou darest Ill give thee remedy

O bid me leap rather than marry Paris
From off the battlements of yonder tower
Or walk in thievish ways or bid me lurk
Where serpents are chain me with roaring bears
Or shut me nightly in a charnelhouse
Oercoverd quite with dead mens rattling bones
With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls
Or bid me go into a newmade grave
And hide me with a dead man in his shroud
Things that to hear them told have made me tremble
And I will do it without fear or doubt
To live an unstaind wife to my sweet love

FRIAR LAURENCE Hold then go home be merry give consent
To marry Paris Wednesday is tomorrow
Tomorrow night look that thou lie alone
Let not thy nurse lie with thee in thy chamber
Take thou this vial being then in bed
And this distilled liquor drink thou off
When presently through all thy veins shall run
A cold and drowsy humour for no pulse
Shall keep his native progress but surcease
No warmth no breath shall testify thou livest
The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade
To paly ashes thy eyes windows fall
Like death when he shuts up the day of life
Each part deprived of supple government
Shall stiff and stark and cold appear like death
And in this borrowd likeness of shrunk death
Thou shalt continue two and forty hours
And then awake as from a pleasant sleep
Now when the bridegroom in the morning comes
To rouse thee from thy bed there art thou dead
Then as the manner of our country is
In thy best robes uncoverd on the bier
Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault
Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie
In the mean time against thou shalt awake
Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift
And hither shall he come and he and I
Will watch thy waking and that very night
Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua
And this shall free thee from this present shame
If no inconstant toy nor womanish fear
Abate thy valour in the acting it

Give me give me O tell not me of fear

FRIAR LAURENCE Hold get you gone be strong and prosperous
In this resolve Ill send a friar with speed
To Mantua with my letters to thy lord

Love give me strength and strength shall help afford
Farewell dear father}

And beg your pardon pardon I beseech you
Henceforward I am ever ruled by you

Send for the county go tell him of this
Ill have this knot knit up tomorrow morning

I met the youthful lord at Laurence cell
And gave him what becomed love I might
Not step oer the bounds of modesty

Why I am glad ont this is well stand up
This is ast should be Let me see the county
Ay marry go I say and fetch him hither
Now afore God this reverend holy friar
Our whole city is much bound to him

Nurse will you go with me into my closet
To help me sort such needful ornaments
As you think fit to furnish me tomorrow

No not till Thursday there is time enough

Go nurse go with her well to church tomorrow



We shall be short in our provision
Tis now near night

Tush I will stir about
And all things shall be well I warrant thee wife
Go thou to Juliet help to deck up her
Ill not to bed tonight let me alone
Ill play the housewife for this once What ho
They are all forth Well I will walk myself
To County Paris to prepare him up
Against tomorrow my heart is wondrous light
Since this same wayward girl is so reclaimd}

To move the heavens to smile upon my state
Which well thou knowst is cross and full of sin

No madam we have culld such necessaries
As are behoveful for our state tomorrow
So please you let me now be left alone
And let the nurse this night sit up with you
For I am sure you have your hands full all
In this so sudden business

Good night
Get thee to bed and rest for thou hast need


Farewell God knows when we shall meet again
I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins
That almost freezes up the heat of life
Ill call them back again to comfort me
Nurse What should she do here
My dismal scene I needs must act alone
Come vial
What if this mixture do not work at all
Shall I be married then tomorrow morning
No no this shall forbid it lie thou there}

{What if it be a poison which the friar
Subtly hath ministerd to have me dead
Lest in this marriage he should be dishonourd
Because he married me before to Romeo
I fear it is and yet methinks it should not
For he hath still been tried a holy man
How if when I am laid into the tomb
I wake before the time that Romeo
Come to redeem me theres a fearful point
Shall I not then be stifled in the vault
To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in
And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes
Or if I live is it not very like
The horrible conceit of death and night
Together with the terror of the place
As in a vault an ancient receptacle
Where for these many hundred years the bones
Of all my buried ancestors are packed
Where bloody Tybalt yet but green in earth
Lies festering in his shroud where as they say
At some hours in the night spirits resort
Alack alack is it not like that I
So early waking what with loathsome smells
And shrieks like mandrakes torn out of the earth
That living mortals hearing them run mad
O if I wake shall I not be distraught
Environed with all these hideous fears
And madly play with my forefathers joints
And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud
And in this rage with some great kinsmans bone
As with a club dash out my desperate brains
O look methinks I see my cousins ghost
Seeking out Romeo that did spit his body
Upon a rapiers point stay Tybalt stay
Romeo I come this do I drink to thee}

{Hold take these keys and fetch more spices nurse

They call for dates and quinces in the pastry



Come stir stir stir the second cock hath crowd
The curfewbell hath rung tis three oclock
Look to the baked meats good Angelica
Spare not for the cost

Go you cotquean go
Get you to bed faith Youll be sick tomorrow
For this nights watching

No not a whit what I have watchd ere now
All night for lesser cause and neer been sick

Ay you have been a mousehunt in your time
But I will watch you from such watching now


A jealous hood a jealous hood



Now fellow
Whats there

First Things for the cook sir but I know not what

Make haste make haste



Sirrah fetch drier logs
Call Peter he will show thee where they are

Second I have a head sir that will find out logs
And never trouble Peter for the matter



Mass and well said a merry whoreson ha
Thou shalt be loggerhead Good faith tis day
The county will be here with music straight
For so he said he would I hear him near}

Shes dead deceased shes dead alack the day

Her blood is settled and her joints are stiff
Life and these lips have long been separated
Death lies on her like an untimely frost
Upon the sweetest flower of all the field}

Death that hath taen her hence to make me wail
Ties up my tongue and will not let me speak

Ready to go but never to return
O son the night before thy weddingday
Hath Death lain with thy wife There she lies
Flower as she was deflowered by him
Death is my soninlaw Death is my heir
My daughter he hath wedded I will die
And leave him all life living all is Deaths

Have I thought long to see this mornings face
And doth it give me such a sight as this

Accursed unhappy wretched hateful day
Most miserable hour that eer time saw
In lasting labour of his pilgrimage
But one poor one one poor and loving child
But one thing to rejoice and solace in
And cruel death hath catchd it from my sight

O woe O woful woful woful day
Most lamentable day most woful day
That ever ever I did yet behold
O day O day O day O hateful day
Never was seen so black a day as this

{FRIAR LAURENCE Peace ho for shame confusions cure lives not
In these confusions Heaven and yourself
Had part in this fair maid now heaven hath all
And all the better is it for the maid
Your part in her you could not keep from death
But heaven keeps his part in eternal life
The most you sought was her promotion
For twas your heaven she should be advanced
And weep ye now seeing she is advanced
Above the clouds as high as heaven itself
O in this love you love your child so ill
That you run mad seeing that she is well
Shes not well married that lives married long
But shes best married that dies married young
Dry up your tears and stick your rosemary
On this fair corse and as the custom is
In all her best array bear her to church
For though fond nature bids us an lament
Yet natures tears are reasons merriment

All things that we ordained festival
Turn from their office to black funeral
Our instruments to melancholy bells
Our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast
Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change
Our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse
And all things change them to the contrary

FRIAR LAURENCE Sir go you in and madam go with him
And go Sir Paris every one prepare
To follow this fair corse unto her grave
The heavens do lour upon you for some ill
Move them no more by crossing their high will}

{If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep
My dreams presage some joyful news at hand
My bosoms lord sits lightly in his throne
And all this day an unaccustomd spirit
Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts
I dreamt my lady came and found me dead
Strange dream that gives a dead man leave
to think
And breathed such life with kisses in my lips
That I revived and was an emperor
Ah me how sweet is love itself possessd
When but loves shadows are so rich in joy



News from VeronaHow now Balthasar
Dost thou not bring me letters from the friar
How doth my lady Is my father well
How fares my Juliet that I ask again
For nothing can be ill if she be well

Then she is well and nothing can be ill
Her body sleeps in Capels monument
And her immortal part with angels lives
I saw her laid low in her kindreds vault
And presently took post to tell it you
O pardon me for bringing these ill news
Since you did leave it for my office sir

Is it even so then I defy you stars
Thou knowst my lodging get me ink and paper
And hire posthorses I will hence tonight

I do beseech you sir have patience
Your looks are pale and wild and do import
Some misadventure

Tush thou art deceived
Leave me and do the thing I bid thee do
Hast thou no letters to me from the friar

No my good lord

No matter get thee gone
And hire those horses Ill be with thee straight}

{Well Juliet I will lie with thee tonight
Lets see for means O mischief thou art swift
To enter in the thoughts of desperate men
I do remember an apothecary
And hereabouts he dwellswhich late I noted
In tatterd weeds with overwhelming brows
Culling of simples meagre were his looks
Sharp misery had worn him to the bones
And in his needy shop a tortoise hung
An alligator stuffd and other skins
Of illshaped fishes and about his shelves
A beggarly account of empty boxes
Green earthen pots bladders and musty seeds
Remnants of packthread and old cakes of roses
Were thinly scatterd to make up a show
Noting this penury to myself I said
An if a man did need a poison now
Whose sale is present death in Mantua
Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him
O this same thought did but forerun my need
And this same needy man must sell it me
As I remember this should be the house
Being holiday the beggars shop is shut
What ho apothecary}

{Apothecary Who calls so loud

Come hither man I see that thou art poor
Hold there is forty ducats let me have
A dram of poison such soonspeeding gear
As will disperse itself through all the veins
That the lifeweary taker may fall dead
And that the trunk may be discharged of breath
As violently as hasty powder fired
Doth hurry from the fatal cannons womb

Apothecary Such mortal drugs I have but Mantuas law
Is death to any he that utters them

Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness
And fearst to die famine is in thy cheeks
Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes
Contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back
The world is not thy friend nor the worlds law
The world affords no law to make thee rich
Then be not poor but break it and take this

Apothecary My poverty but not my will consents

I pay thy poverty and not thy will

Apothecary Put this in any liquid thing you will
And drink it off and if you had the strength
Of twenty men it would dispatch you straight

There is thy gold worse poison to mens souls
Doing more murders in this loathsome world
Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell
I sell thee poison thou hast sold me none
Farewell buy food and get thyself in flesh
Come cordial and not poison go with me
To Juliets grave for there must I use thee}

{FRIAR JOHN Holy Franciscan friar brother ho



FRIAR LAURENCE This same should be the voice of Friar John
Welcome from Mantua what says Romeo
Or if his mind be writ give me his letter

FRIAR JOHN Going to find a barefoot brother out
One of our order to associate me
Here in this city visiting the sick
And finding him the searchers of the town
Suspecting that we both were in a house
Where the infectious pestilence did reign
Seald up the doors and would not let us forth
So that my speed to Mantua there was stayd

FRIAR LAURENCE Who bare my letter then to Romeo

FRIAR JOHN I could not send ithere it is again
Nor get a messenger to bring it thee
So fearful were they of infection

FRIAR LAURENCE Unhappy fortune by my brotherhood
The letter was not nice but full of charge
Of dear import and the neglecting it
May do much danger Friar John go hence
Get me an iron crow and bring it straight
Unto my cell

FRIAR JOHN Brother Ill go and bring it thee



FRIAR LAURENCE Now must I to the monument alone
Within three hours will fair Juliet wake
She will beshrew me much that Romeo
Hath had no notice of these accidents
But I will write again to Mantua
And keep her at my cell till Romeo come
Poor living corse closed in a dead mans tomb}

{Give me thy torch boy hence and stand aloof
Yet put it out for I would not be seen
Under yond yewtrees lay thee all along
Holding thine ear close to the hollow ground
So shall no foot upon the churchyard tread
Being loose unfirm with digging up of graves
But thou shalt hear it whistle then to me
As signal that thou hearst something approach
Give me those flowers Do as I bid thee go

PAGE I am almost afraid to stand alone
Here in the churchyard yet I will adventure



Sweet flower with flowers thy bridal bed I strew
O woe thy canopy is dust and stones
Which with sweet water nightly I will dew
Or wanting that with tears distilld by moans
The obsequies that I for thee will keep
Nightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep



The boy gives warning something doth approach
What cursed foot wanders this way tonight
To cross my obsequies and true loves rite
What with a torch muffle me night awhile}

{Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron
Hold take this letter early in the morning
See thou deliver it to my lord and father
Give me the light upon thy life I charge thee
Whateer thou hearst or seest stand all aloof
And do not interrupt me in my course
Why I descend into this bed of death
Is partly to behold my ladys face
But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger
A precious ring a ring that I must use
In dear employment therefore hence be gone
But if thou jealous dost return to pry
In what I further shall intend to do
By heaven I will tear thee joint by joint
And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs
The time and my intents are savagewild
More fierce and more inexorable far
Than empty tigers or the roaring sea

I will be gone sir and not trouble you

So shalt thou show me friendship Take thou that
Live and be prosperous and farewell good fellow

For all this same Ill hide me hereabout
His looks I fear and his intents I doubt



Thou detestable maw thou womb of death
Gorged with the dearest morsel of the earth
Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open
And in despite Ill cram thee with more food



This is that banishd haughty Montague
That murderd my loves cousin with which grief
It is supposed the fair creature died
And here is come to do some villanous shame
To the dead bodies I will apprehend him}

Can vengeance be pursued further than death
Condemned villain I do apprehend thee
Obey and go with me for thou must die

I must indeed and therefore came I hither
Good gentle youth tempt not a desperate man
Fly hence and leave me think upon these gone
Let them affright thee I beseech thee youth
Put not another sin upon my head
By urging me to fury O be gone
By heaven I love thee better than myself
For I come hither armd against myself
Stay not be gone live and hereafter say
A madmans mercy bade thee run away

I do defy thy conjurations
And apprehend thee for a felon here

Wilt thou provoke me then have at thee boy

O I am slain



If thou be merciful
Open the tomb lay me with Juliet}

{How oft when men are at the point of death
Have they been merry which their keepers call
A lightning before death O how may I
Call this a lightning O my love my wife
Death that hath suckd the honey of thy breath
Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty
Thou art not conquerd beautys ensign yet
Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks
And deaths pale flag is not advanced there
Tybalt liest thou there in thy bloody sheet
O what more favour can I do to thee
Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain
To sunder his that was thine enemy
Forgive me cousin Ah dear Juliet
Why art thou yet so fair shall I believe
That unsubstantial death is amorous
And that the lean abhorred monster keeps
Thee here in dark to be his paramour
For fear of that I still will stay with thee
And never from this palace of dim night
Depart again here here will I remain
With worms that are thy chambermaids O here
Will I set up my everlasting rest
And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars
From this worldwearied flesh Eyes look your last
Arms take your last embrace and lips O you
The doors of breath seal with a righteous kiss
A dateless bargain to engrossing death
Come bitter conduct come unsavoury guide
Thou desperate pilot now at once run on
The dashing rocks thy seasick weary bark
Heres to my love



O true apothecary
Thy drugs are quick Thus with a kiss I die




FRIAR LAURENCE Saint Francis be my speed how oft tonight
Have my old feet stumbled at graves Whos there

Heres one a friend and one that knows you well

FRIAR LAURENCE Bliss be upon you Tell me good my friend
What torch is yond that vainly lends his light
To grubs and eyeless skulls as I discern
It burneth in the Capels monument

It doth so holy sir and theres my master
One that you love

FRIAR LAURENCE Who is it}

FRIAR LAURENCE How long hath he been there

Full half an hour

FRIAR LAURENCE Go with me to the vault

I dare not sir
My master knows not but I am gone hence
And fearfully did menace me with death
If I did stay to look on his intents

FRIAR LAURENCE Stay then Ill go alone Fear comes upon me
O much I fear some ill unlucky thing

As I did sleep under this yewtree here
I dreamt my master and another fought
And that my master slew him

FRIAR LAURENCE Romeo



Alack alack what blood is this which stains
The stony entrance of this sepulchre
What mean these masterless and gory swords
To lie discolourd by this place of peace



Romeo O pale Who else what Paris too
And steepd in blood Ah what an unkind hour
Is guilty of this lamentable chance
The lady stirs



O comfortable friar where is my lord
I do remember well where I should be
And there I am Where is my Romeo}

{FRIAR LAURENCE I will be brief for my short date of breath
Is not so long as is a tedious tale
Romeo there dead was husband to that Juliet
And she there dead that Romeos faithful wife
I married them and their stoln marriageday
Was Tybalts doomsday whose untimely death
Banishd the newmade bridegroom from the city
For whom and not for Tybalt Juliet pined
You to remove that siege of grief from her
Betrothd and would have married her perforce
To County Paris then comes she to me
And with wild looks bid me devise some mean
To rid her from this second marriage
Or in my cell there would she kill herself
Then gave I her so tutord by my art
A sleeping potion which so took effect
As I intended for it wrought on her
The form of death meantime I writ to Romeo
That he should hither come as this dire night
To help to take her from her borrowd grave
Being the time the potions force should cease
But he which bore my letter Friar John
Was stayd by accident and yesternight
Returnd my letter back Then all alone
At the prefixed hour of her waking
Came I to take her from her kindreds vault
Meaning to keep her closely at my cell
Till I conveniently could send to Romeo
But when I came some minute ere the time
Of her awaking here untimely lay
The noble Paris and true Romeo dead
She wakes and I entreated her come forth
And bear this work of heaven with patience
But then a noise did scare me from the tomb
And she too desperate would not go with me
But as it seems did violence on herself
All this I know and to the marriage
Her nurse is privy and if aught in this
Miscarried by my fault let my old life
Be sacrificed some hour before his time
Unto the rigour of severest law

PRINCE We still have known thee for a holy man
Wheres Romeos man what can he say in this

I brought my master news of Juliets death
And then in post he came from Mantua
To this same place to this same monument
This letter he early bid me give his father
And threatened me with death going in the vault
I departed not and left him there

PRINCE Give me the letter I will look on it
Where is the countys page that raised the watch
Sirrah what made your master in this place}

{PAGE He came with flowers to strew his ladys grave
And bid me stand aloof and so I did
Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb
And by and by my master drew on him
And then I ran away to call the watch

PRINCE This letter doth make good the friars words
Their course of love the tidings of her death
And here he writes that he did buy a poison
Of a poor pothecary and therewithal
Came to this vault to die and lie with Juliet
Where be these enemies Capulet Montague
See what a scourge is laid upon your hate
That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love
And I for winking at your discords too
Have lost a brace of kinsmen all are punishd

O brother Montague give me thy hand
This is my daughters jointure for no more
Can I demand

But I can give thee more
For I will raise her statue in pure gold
That while Verona by that name is known
There shall no figure at such rate be set
As that of true and faithful Juliet

As rich shall Romeos by his ladys lie
Poor sacrifices of our enmity

PRINCE A glooming peace this morning with it brings
The sun for sorrow will not show his head
Go hence to have more talk of these sad things
Some shall be pardond and some punished
For never was a story of more woe
Than this of Juliet and her Romeo}
